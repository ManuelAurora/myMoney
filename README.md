This project I made for myself primeraly.
It created for money management, some cool features will be added soon, which I will describe later on.

For now it is possible:

- Delete documents.
- All actions are saved in Core Data and NSUserDefaults.

Working on:

- Charts. On the main screen I want to make adorable chart view.
- Functionality which will allow move money between accounts. 
- Enter new currencies.
